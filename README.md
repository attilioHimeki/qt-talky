## Features
- Define dialogue flows using nodes and links. 
- Multi-platform, can be built on Windows, Mac or even mobile devices.
- As the resulting work is exported to a JSON file, the tool is engine-agnostic and can be easily integrated in any workflow using Unity, UnrealEngine, CryEngine or any other commercial or custom engine.
